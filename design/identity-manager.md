## Overview

Enterprise Identity Managers are dedicated applications for the creation and management of all identities with an organisation. The Signata Identity Manager is the equivalent to this, but serving self-sovereign web3 identities. Users can create and manage all their own web3 identities within a single interface, and prepare them for use with the Signata Identity Provider.
