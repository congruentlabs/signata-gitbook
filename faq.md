# FAQ

## Where is the whitepaper?

There was a whitepaper for the project, but a living design document here in this documentation website is superior for capturing the current state of the solution design as it evolves.

## Where is the roadmap?

Because the Signata token shared the name with Signata dApp, this was causing incorrect attribution of dApp development with the token itself. Roadmaps have been removed to reset these expectations from viewers, and dApps sharing the Signata name may be renamed in the future to prevent further confusion.

## Why is there no team on the website?

The Signata Token has been transitioned to community control by the Signata DAO (dSATA). The only "team" now for the Signata Token is anyone who holds dSATA tokens.

Congruent Labs provide DAO Custody services for the dSATA DAO.

Congruent Labs also perform some development work on dApps. Because these had shared the name with the token, these were causing incorrect attribution of the dApp development with the token. dApps sharing the Signata name may be renamed in the future to prevent further confusion.

## Who are the competitors?

Signata smart contracts are Identity **Management** contracts. Signata identities, and any other web3 identity, are all derived from the same cryptographic information. Signata web3 identities do not "compete" with other web3 identities, the smart contracts just provide useful tools to enhance them.

## Why is dSATA different to SATA?

dSATA is the DAO voting token for Signata. SATA tokens are cross-chain and already in circulation. Using SATA tokens for voting on an on-chain DAO would not be possible in their current state. On-chain DAO contracts require enhanced ERC20 token features to be usable for voting, of which make them more expensive to transact with and discourage utility. And DAOs cannot be operated across multiple chains.

dSATA provides all the capability of an on-chain DAO without negatively impacting the utility of the SATA token.

## Why is there no official telegram group?

Because the Signata token shares the name with Signata dApp, this was causing incorrect attribution of dApp development with the token itself. In addition, the telegram community was not supporting or contributing to dApp development or dApp integrations for Signata. There are plenty of other channels for discussion of dApp development or how to develop integrations, of which can be found on the Links page:
