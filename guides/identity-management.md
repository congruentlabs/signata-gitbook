## Wallet Identities

### Creating a Wallet Identity

In the **Add Identity** section, click on the **Wallet** tab.

Click **Generate** to randomly generate a new set of Identity seeds. The delegate for your identity will be your connected wallet.

Click **Add Identity**.

### Renaming a Wallet Identity

{% hint style="info" %}
Identity names are just so you can easily identify which identity is which. The names are not visible to anyone else, and are not written to the blockchain.
{% endhint %}

In your identity, click **Rename**.

A confirmation window will appear. Specify your new identity name and click **Save New Name**.

### Registering a Wallet Identity

{% hint style="info" %}
Registering an identity writes it to the blockchain. This will incur a transaction fee from the network. If you hold 10 SATA it is free to register an identity, otherwise you'll have to pay a small fee.
{% endhint %}

In your identity, click **Register**.

Confirm the transaction with your wallet.

### Deleting a Wallet Identity

{% hint style="warning" %}
Identities can only be deleted if they haven't been registered. Registering your identity writes it to the blockchain, and so you can destroy it on-chain but not delete it once it's registered.
{% endhint %}

In your identity, click **Delete**.

A confirmation window will appear. Click **Delete Identity**.

{% hint style="info" %}
A nano identity is a limited version of a Signata identity. If you want to try out Signata, you can register your connected wallet as a Nano Identity. If you hold 10 SATA it is free to create a Nano identity, otherwise you'll have to pay a small fee.

In the **Add Identity** section, click on the **Nano** tab.

Click **Create Nano Identity**.

### Locking a Nano Identity

{% hint style="info" %}
Locking your identity will prevent it from being used to authenticate or by smart contracts that use Signata identities. You should only lock your identity if you think your wallet has been compromised.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
Undelegated Nano Identities **cannot** be unlocked once locked. Make sure you only lock your identity if you genuinely believe it has been compromised.
{% endhint %}

In the **Nano Identity** section, click **Lock**.

A confirmation window will appear. Click **Lock**.

Confirm the transaction with your wallet.
