## Wallet Identities

### Creating a Wallet Identity

In the **Add Identity** section, click on the **Wallet** tab.

Click **Generate** to randomly generate a new set of Identity seeds. The delegate for your identity will be your connected wallet.

Click **Add Identity**.

### Renaming a Wallet Identity

{% hint style="info" %}
Identity names are just so you can easily identify which identity is which. The names are not visible to anyone else, and are not written to the blockchain.
{% endhint %}

In your identity, click **Rename**.

A confirmation window will appear. Specify your new identity name and click **Save New Name**.

### Registering a Wallet Identity

{% hint style="info" %}
Registering an identity writes it to the blockchain. This will incur a transaction fee from the network. If you hold 10 SATA it is free to register an identity, otherwise you'll have to pay a small fee.
{% endhint %}

In your identity, click **Register**.

Confirm the transaction with your wallet.

### Deleting a Wallet Identity

{% hint style="warning" %}
Identities can only be deleted if they haven't been registered. Registering your identity writes it to the blockchain, and so you can destroy it on-chain but not delete it once it's registered.
{% endhint %}

In your identity, click **Delete**.

A confirmation window will appear. Click **Delete Identity**.
